# [Master Server Perfection] #
1.  Login/Logout must be free from dupes and rollbacks [perhaps implement 30 seconds to login to the game from another world]

[Friends Chat]

# [FORUM INTEGRATION]

1.  Display names can be changed over the forums 31 days and will be 12 characters MAX. [DONOR ONLY]
2.  Login password must be your forum password
	-   Perhaps implement the Bcrypt hash checking to skip verifying passwords on each login attempt.
3.  Account creation creates a forum account on the master server worker.
	-   We should have a flag that notifies the player that their forum account was created for them on login during this process
