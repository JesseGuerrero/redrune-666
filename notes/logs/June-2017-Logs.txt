		-   Including the projectile
	+   Added proper calculation of magic spells with delays [stacking works perfectly if ur rushing from tiles away]
	+   Improved leeches significantly
		-   Previously the leeches were applied when the hit landed, this isn't how it was in runescape [had to watch some videos]
		-   I made them applied when the combat is ticked, and now the leech will overlap your combat animation [credits affliction for info]
		-   Changed chat messages for leeches, they only send one message if you're maxed instead of flooding your chatbox with info.

	+   Updated range accuracy & defense combat calculations [with precision based on real runescape formulas (this info was calculated publicly)]
		-   Even the combat style you're on has a small bonus on your defense calculation like on RS
		-   Accuracy also takes into account your attack level boost from the base attack level requirement of the weapon you're wielding
	+   Confirmed max hit calculations for all melee, range, and magic using accurate runescape calculations
		-   Information if you're interested in javascript: https://pastebin.com/7LcSpvu4
	+   Added special attack accuracy multiplier for several different weapon types, basing information from runescape's.
	+   Added potions [only base potions at the moment]
		-   Noted that in 2011 there was no combat speed after sipping a potion... however combat did stop.
	+   Updated dharok max hit calculation to be accurate to runescape's
		-   At exactly 1 lifepoint u can max a 1008 on a player[with the best combat bonuses with dharoks, turmoil, and super pots]
	+   Updated 'roll' algorithm to be more realistic [we don't want to be able to hit 0-0 on mystics too often, etc....]
	+   Made autocast spells reset when u equip a weapon
	+   Stopped duplicate texts from being sent [so ur not spammed w/ 'mysterious force stops u....']

		-   ::itemn armadyl drop    ->  this will find all items that have 'armadyl' in their name
			-   and that have 'drop' in their inventory options
		-   Mainly used for admins+, but in beta testing this will be good for beta testers.
	+   Added the destroy item interface [when you attempt to drop an item that's untradeable/destroyable/lended]
	+   Added item definition checking for lended items [as well as changing their last definition server sided to 'discard' [not 'drop' like their regular parts]
	+   Added interface closing event to inventory item slot swapping

	+   Added ava's accumulator effect
	+   Fixed a scheduled task bug that wouldn't allow tasks that had a speed > 1 to happen
		-   Also removed 'immediate' task types -> these are never needed

	+   Added magic shortbow & magic longbow special attack with perfect projectiles & accuracy
	+   Added ammo stacking on the floor instead of new floor items being created each time an arrow is shot
