1. Master Server Goes Online
2. Master Client [Communication] connects to master server
	->	If the connection is dropped we have to start a new attempt every x seconds.
		->	Once a new connection is made we send all the data the client currently holds over to the master server
		->	Tell the server that we have these players on world 'y'
	->	If the connection is not able to be done originally, the connection active worker keeps trying
	->	TCP doesn't worry about connection lost for the most part though [important to handle still]
	->	If the connection to the master server is broken, players online will suffer not being able to send messages to clans/friends
		->	Also they will not be able to log in. Login is fully based on the master server
3.	Master Server Connection is GOOD! How do we communicate with the worlds?
	+	Clients first send their id and their secure key token. If these two aren't already registered in the master server it's good to go.
	+	Secure key token used incase code is leaked and we're flooded with master server information.
4.	Once the connection is secured, we have different types of packets to send:
	+	Login Request
	+	Contacts
		-	Friend List
			+   Messaging [DONE]
				-   Message is sent to the master server, which then sends it to the right client
			+   Status updating [DONE]
				-   Status is sent to the master server, which then tells all the people who have the player on their friend list
			+   Friend List [DONE]
				-   We save the list of contacts that we have
					+   When the player logs in, we send a request for the contact
					+   The master server then delivers each friend back to the client as an individual packet
					+
	+	Friend Chat
		-	Joining
		-	Leaving
		-	Messaging
		-	Creation
	+
